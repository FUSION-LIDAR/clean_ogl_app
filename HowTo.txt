Using openGL stuff in applications

Assumes Dialog based app...see oglAppDlg.cpp and oglAppDlg.h for examples

Add a CCleanGLWnd* member variable to the dialog class
In the dialog constructor, create a new CCleanGLWnd object
In the dialog destructor, delete the object
In the dialog resource, create a placeholder for the upper left corner of the OpenGL view
In InitDialog(), create and position the window
In the dialogs OnSize handler, reposition the openGL window

CCleanGLWnd (and COpenGLWnd base class) require the following classes
	CImage
		CImageProgress
		CDib
	CFileSpec

The project needs to include opengl libs and image libs
linker settings for libraries:
	opengl32.lib glu32.lib ..\common\image\jpeg.lib ..\common\image\tlib.lib 

The project also needs the IDD_IMAGELOADPROGRESS dialog to go with the CImage class progress reporting capability
